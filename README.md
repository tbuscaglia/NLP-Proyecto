# Linking Fan Expectations and Match Outcomes to Online Behaviour
Reddit Data â€“ English Premier League 2021/22

## Project Idea  
This project studies how football match results influence online fan behaviour. We collected Reddit comments from team-specific subreddits during the 2021/22 English Premier League season and combined them with match outcomes. To capture the link between expectations and results, we developed a modified Gap Score, a metric that measures whether a result was better or worse than predicted. The objective was to understand how fans react linguistically to wins and losses, and whether positive or negative outcomes affect the way they express themselves.  

## Methods and Tools  
The analysis relied on three Natural Language Processing approaches. First, we applied VADER for sentiment analysis, classifying comments as positive, neutral, or negative and examining how sentiment changed before and after matches. Second, we used TF-IDF for topic modeling, identifying the most informative words across different Gap Score quantiles to compare the language of satisfied and disappointed fans. Third, we employed LIWC for style analysis, studying linguistic features such as pronouns, emotions, and negations to see how writing style varied depending on the match result.  

## Key Findings  
The results show that negative outcomes have a stronger effect on online fan behaviour than positive ones. Fans tend to react more sharply to defeats, while victories generate milder shifts in sentiment. In positive contexts, player names and celebratory expressions appear frequently, while negative contexts are dominated by criticism of players, owners, and team performance. The style analysis confirms that fans adapt their language depending on results: victories are associated with positive emotions, family references, and personal voice, while defeats lead to more negations, functional words, and collective voice.
